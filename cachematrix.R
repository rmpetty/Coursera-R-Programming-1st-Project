## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit 
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The 
## following code provides functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inverse <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and 
## the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the 
## inverse from the cache. Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be 
## done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is a square invertible 
## matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
}
